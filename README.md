# 1Strem Browser Extension

1Stream is a chrome extension that allows you to watch Netflix or Youtube streams in sync with a friend.

2. Choose the episode or video you want to watch on Netflix or Youtube.
3. Click the 1Stream icon at the top right corner.
4. Copy the link and send it to your friend.

## Development

### Running your own signaling server

The extension uses peerjs hosted server by default. If you want to run your own signaling server, you can read the [peerjs docs](https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server) to get started.

They offer a docker image so that you can run the container as follows.

```
 docker run -p 9000:9000 --name 1stream-signaling -d peerjs/peerjs-server
```

The next step if changing the configuration in the room.js file

```
Room.serverOptions = {
  host: "YOUR HOSTNAME",
  port: 9000,
  path: "/myapp",
};
```

## Known issues

- Sometimes the browser caches the JS, try to do a hard refresh.
- The signaling server does not remove clients from the room yet, you need to restart the signaling server every time, sorry...
